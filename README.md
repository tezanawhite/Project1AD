<h1> Practice Creating Active Directory in Windows Server on VMWare Workstation Pro 17</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo)

<h2> Project Summary</h2>
This was a hands-on project where I walked through setting up Active Directory from scratch on a Windows Server 2022 virtual machine. I installed the OS, promoted the server to a domain controller, created a domain, set up OUs for different regions and departments, and added user accounts and groups. The entire setup is fully functional and can be used as a base for more advanced Active Directory or network administration labs.

<h2> Active Directory Setup Using Windows Server 2022 in VMware Workstation Pro 17</h2>
For this project, I set up Active Directory on a Windows Server 2022 virtual machine using VMware Workstation Pro 17. The goal was to create a domain environment from scratch, build organizational units (OUs), and set up user accounts and groups â€” basically a foundational lab for anyone learning how to work with Active Directory.
